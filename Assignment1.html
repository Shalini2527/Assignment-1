               <h3>Ooty, Tamil Nadu</h3>
               <pre>
                The Blue Mountains have always been shrouded in mysticism, and Ooty is no exception to that. 
                For every mountain lover, the very idea of travelling to the city known as the Queen of the Hills 
                holds an allure like no other. Once regarded as the summer headquarters of the East India Company
                (and for a very good reason), Ooty, also known as Udagamandalam, is a hill station in Tamil Nadu 
                which serves as a very popular tourist destination for anyone looking for a picturesque place to 
                relax and unwind. Ooty is nestled amidst the Nilgiri hills at an altitude of 2,240 meters above
